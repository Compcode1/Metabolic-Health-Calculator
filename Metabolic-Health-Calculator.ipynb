    "#### **Metabolic Health Risk Calculator**\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of having 3 out of 5 Metabolic Syndrome risk factors is a widely accepted criterion for diagnosing Metabolic Syndrome. Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The five risk factors include increased waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose. In this algorithm BMI is not considered an independent risk factor.\n",
    "This health risk calculator considers BMI status as a strong indpendent risk variable in conjuction with other well established Metabolic Syndrome variables. The evidence supporting BMI as an independent health risk factor is extensive and robust. Elevated BMI is associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, respiratory conditions, musculoskeletal disorders, and increased mortality. These associations are supported by both epidemiological data and biological mechanisms. Therefore, incorporating BMI as a significant variable in health risk assessments is well-justified.\n",
    "Inclusion of BMI helps identify individuals at higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Currently the diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome is binary: if an individual has 3 or more of the 5 risk factors, they are diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome, if they have fewer than 3 of the 5 risk factors, they are not diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome. I have replaced this binary system with a risk score comprised of a scale 0 - 18 with associated categorization. This enhances the prognostic value of the metrics in regard to an individual developing serious health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases (heart attack, stroke), type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic kidney disease.\n",
    "Additionally, inclusion of BMI in this algorithm contributes to proper calculations for younger individuals with high BMI status without (other than positive Waist Circumference values) additional positive values. Without incorporating BMI status into calculations there is no acknowlegemnent of the high likeihood of additional risk factors developing over time. This is not stastistically sound logic. In reality younger indiduals who maintain elevated BMI status do develop positive risk factors as a function of BMI status and associated physiology.\n",
    "The algorithm employed utilizes weighted scores to various metabolic risk factors in order to calculate an overall health risk score. Each poitive risk factor contributes to the total score based on its severity.\n",
    "The BMI score is calculated by assigning points based on BMI values: 1 point for BMI >= 25, 2 points for BMI >= 30, 3 points for BMI >= 35, and 4 points for BMI >= 40, provided the waist circumference is greater than 35 inches.\n",
    "Waist circumference scores are determined differently for males and females; for males, a waist circumference between 40 and 45 inches is assigned 2 points, between 45 and 50 inches is assigned 3 points, and above 50 inches is assigned 4 points. For females, a waist circumference between 35 and 40 inches is assigned 2 points, between 40 and 45 inches is assigned 3 points, and above 45 inches is assigned 4 points.\n",
    "Triglycerides levels contribute to the score as follows: levels between 150 and 250 mg/dL are assigned 2 points, levels between 250 and 350 mg/dL are assigned 3 points, and levels above 350 mg/dL are assigned 4 points.\n",
    "Fasting blood glucose scores are assigned 1 point for levels above 100 mg/dL, 2 points for levels above 125 mg/dL, and 4 points for levels above 200 mg/dL. HDL cholesterol levels are scored based on gender, with males being assigned 2 points for levels below 40 mg/dL and females being assigned 2 points for levels below 35 mg/dL.\n",
    "High blood pressure status contributes 3 points if the individual has high blood pressure or is being treated with medication for high blood pressure. Future iterations opf this model will utilize systoloic/ diastolic values in place of this current binary system.\n",
    "The total health risk score is calculated by summing the points from all these categories. This weighted scoring system allows for a nuanced assessment of metabolic health, where the presence and severity of each risk factor are taken into account to provide an overall risk evaluation. The algorithm ensures that higher risk factors contribute more significantly to the total score.\n"

    "#### **User inputÂ¶**\n",
    "This code block prompts the user to input specific health metrics and calculates an overall health risk score based on these inputs. The program starts by asking the user to enter their age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, triglyceride levels, fasting blood glucose levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and whether they have been diagnosed with or are being treated for high blood pressure (by entering 1 if they have or 0 if they have not).\n",
    "Once the user provides these inputs, the program calculates individual scores for each category using previously defined functions. It calculates the BMI score based on the user's BMI and waist circumference, the waist score based on gender and waist circumference, and similarly calculates scores for triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, HDL cholesterol, and high blood pressure.\n",
    "After calculating these individual component scores, the program sums them to generate a total health risk score. The program then prints out the individual scores for each category, providing detailed feedback on how each factor contributed to the overall score. If the total score is zero, it informs the user that no risk factors were flagged. Otherwise, it categorizes the total score into a risk category (low, moderate, high, or very high) and displays this information to the user. This structured approach helps users understand their health risk based on multiple metabolic factors and highlights areas that may require attention for improving their overall health.\n"
